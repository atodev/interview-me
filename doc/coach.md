# 5-Day Interview Coach (Premium)

A structured coaching program that prepares you for a real interview over 5 days of guided practice.

## How It Works

1. **Complete an interview** — run through a full mock interview for a role you're targeting
2. **Start coaching** — go to the Coach tab and select that interview to begin a 5-day program
3. **Daily sessions** — each day you get 5 new questions tailored to the role
4. **Coaching feedback** — after each answer, the coach scores you, explains what was strong, what needs work, and shows you an ideal answer
5. **Retry up to 3 times** — if your score is below 8/10, the coach offers "Would you like to try again?" — you can retry each question up to 3 times to improve
6. **New questions each day** — day 2-5 questions are always different from prior days, so you build breadth across the role's requirements
7. **Program complete** — after 5 days you've answered 25+ questions with coaching, well prepared for the real thing

## Benefits

- **Builds muscle memory** — answering interview questions out loud repeatedly trains you to articulate your experience clearly under pressure
- **Targeted feedback** — every answer gets honest scoring (1-10) with specific strengths, improvements, and a model answer you can learn from
- **Progressive difficulty** — questions escalate from accessible to challenging across each day
- **Covers blind spots** — new question sets each day ensure you're tested across all the role's skills, not just the obvious ones
- **Retry flow** — the chance to immediately try again after seeing the ideal answer accelerates learning far faster than just reading feedback
- **Tracks progress** — your scores and attempts are saved so you can see improvement across the 5 days

## Requirements

- **Premium tier** — coaching is exclusive to Premium subscribers
- **Signed in** — you must be authenticated (coaching progress is saved to your account)
- **Completed interview** — you need at least one finished interview to base the coaching program on

## Daily Routine

A typical coaching day takes 15-20 minutes:

1. Open the Coach tab
2. Tap "Start Day X"
3. Listen to each question (read aloud via TTS)
4. Tap the mic and answer naturally
5. Review the coach's feedback and ideal answer
6. Retry if you want to improve, or move to the next question
7. After all 5 questions, the day is marked complete

Come back tomorrow for your next set of questions.
